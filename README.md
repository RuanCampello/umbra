## ‚ú® Not PostgreSQL. Not SQLite. Something... _else_

This project takes certain... liberties with database paradigms. Born from the existential void of a southern hemisphere
summer (December 2024‚ÄìJanuary 2025, when ennui struck like the heatwave), Umbra cosplays as PostgreSQL with its query
planner (proper cost-based optimisation using expression trees, darling‚Äîwe‚Äôre civilised), while harbouring SQLite‚Äôs
scandalous little secrets under the bonnet (_ahem_ `RowId`, you disreputable little implementation detail).

_The bat is non-negotiable._

Let's be clear: **this isn't a replacement for anything,** unless you're replacing sanity with chaos, which
case‚Äîwelcome. The focus here is the **learning process**, read as "the screams of debugging hand-rolled date parsing at
3AM."

## Implementation Status

### üßæ Types
- [x] `INTEGER` (for counting your regrets)
    - [ ] `SERIAL` (auto-increment would be too convenient, init?)
- [x] `BIGINT` (when regular regrets aren't enough)
- [x] `VARCHAR`
- [x] `BOOLEAN`
- [ ] `DECIMAL`
- [ ] `TEXT`
- [x] Temporal types (because time flies when... I ran out of jokes)
    - [x] `DATE`
    - [x] `TIME`
    - [x] `TIMESTAMP` (precision: "ish")

### üîó Constraints
- [x] `PRIMARY KEY`
    - [ ] Auto-incrementing (still manual like the dark ages)
- [x] `UNIQUE` (because duplicates are tacky)
- [ ] `FOREIGN KEY` (relationships are hard)
- [ ] `CHECK`
- [ ] `NOT NULL` (I'm very chill about emptiness)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Operations
#### üíº **Table Operations**
- [x] `CREATE TABLE` *(where hope begins)*
- [x] `DROP TABLE` *(where hope ends)*
- [ ] `ALTER TABLE`

#### üîç SELECT Operations
- [x] `WHERE` (basic filtering, no existential crises)
- [x] `ORDER BY` (implemented after herding literal bats)
- [ ] `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` (self-restraint coming soon‚Ñ¢)
- [ ] Table aliases (`FROM crypts AS c` - naming things is hard)
- [ ] `JOIN` (relationships require couples therapy)
- [ ] `GROUP BY` (aggregation is a social construct)
- [ ] `HAVING` 

#### üí∏ **Transactions**
- [x] `BEGIN` 
- [x] `COMMIT` 
- [x] `ROLLBACK`

#### üìä **Indexes**
- [x] Unique indexes *(exclusivity is key)*
- [ ] Non-unique indexes *(for the masses)*
- [ ] Partial indexes *(discrimination coming soon)*

### üßÆ Basic Functions
- [ ] `COUNT`
- [ ] `AVG`
- [ ] `SUM`

### *‚ú® Just So You Know*

- **Documentation**: [Here be dragons](https://ruancampello.github.io/umbra-documentation/) (*and possibly bats*)
- **Philosophy**: *"Compiling is victory. Running is a miracle."*
