# LeakSanitizer suppressions for known false positives.

# The thread-local storage in the reclamation module uses alloc_zeroed
# to allocate bucket arrays and batches. These are intentionally long-lived
# global structures that may not be freed before process exit.
# This is expected behaviour for epoch-based memory reclamation systems.
